What are Exceptions?
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of programs that disrupt the normal flow of execution (e.g., KeyError Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.) An exception is a Python object that represents an error..

'''
Why use Exception
'''
'''
tandardized error handling: Using built-in exceptions or creating a custom exception with a more precise name and description, you can adequately define the error event, which helps you debug the error event.
Cleaner code: Exceptions separate the error-handling code from regular code, which helps us to maintain large code easily.
Robust application: With the help of exceptions, we can develop a solid application, which can handle error event efficiently
